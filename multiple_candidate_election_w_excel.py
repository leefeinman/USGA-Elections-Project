    # 2: find a way to
    #           - insert new rows for the respective columns so that the data can be added on top of pre-existing data
    #           - remove the column names when the dataframe gets pasted to excel (I'll have my own formatting in excel)
    # 3: running the application through excel?
    #           - the problem is that if I include macros in the excel file, python has a problem writing to it
    #           so I don't know another way around this nonsense. May just need to open the application every time.
    # 4: create a tkinter (or similar) window for inputting and printing information from the program...
    #       I don't want to control this through terminal LOL.
